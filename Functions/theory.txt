3. What are the docstrings in Python?
    Ans: Python documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. It’s specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code. Unlike conventional source code comments, the docstring should describe what the function does, not how.

    Declaring Docstrings: The docstrings are declared using ”’triple single quotes”’ or “”” triple double quotes “”” just below the class, method, or function declaration. All functions should have a docstring.
    Accessing Docstrings: The docstrings can be accessed using the __doc__ method of the object or using the help function. The below examples demonstrate how to declare and access a docstring.
